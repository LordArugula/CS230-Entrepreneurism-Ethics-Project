# Entrepreneurism & Ethics Project
This project examines the practice of Ethics in modern startup and entrepreneurial activities. Your group will form a fictitious company creating a feasible/real technology product or service. You will develop the 4 items below that will discuss not only the fundamental concept behind your company and its founders (your group) but, highlight its Cultural and Ethical Policies and selected Ethics Board members. Details of what you are to create and a timeline follow. Please treat this as a real startup and you should select ethics board members as real people and describe in their bio what key expertise they bring to your company's ethics board.

## Item 1 : Business Plan (minimum 500 words)

A. Company Name of Fictitious Company (make it a name you would like - treat this like a real startup). Remember this must be a tech company.

B. Long-Term Vision Statement
 1. What are the goals?
  2. Where did your idea come from (a class, a job, a need)?
  3. What is the purpose, values and mission? List 2 or 3 key questions that will guide the startup's choices. These should be essential questions that serve as touchstones to direct your companies efforts. For instance, how can the startup have impact? What engages our passions?

C. External opportunities that exist
Here are some ideas you may consider:
 * Opportunities like co-marketing (i.e. how your new headphones work great with Nike shoes for a great workout)
 * funding opportunities you found (through government, VCs, Angel investors, etc), 
 * co-development possibilities with other companies (maybe you can make a Nike version of your headphones)
 * special conferences, trade meetings where you could present your product/service
 * give-aways, hackathons, promotional deals, etc.
Give REAL ideas not fake ones. Mention real companies and provide links to their homepage. For venture capital (VC) give websites and discuss why THAT VC would be interested in YOUR startup (they specialize in human computing and your headphones would fit the profile of their past investments), Special conferences & how they fit with YOUR product/service and give URL.

D. Teams - Give a picture and a [biography for each person](http://borg.csueastbay.edu/~grewe/CS230/Mat/EthicsInfo/BiosStrengths.html) in the leadership of your company (which are your group mates) and discuss their strengths as it i relates to the formation of this startup tech company. [Read this for more detailed discussion and example](http://borg.csueastbay.edu/~grewe/CS230/Mat/EthicsInfo/BiosStrengths.html).

E. Strategy: for next 3 to 5 years. In addition, please share at least one case study of the closest potential competitor and what you learned from it in terms of maximizing the startups potential for the future.
  * key milestones/checkpoints described by OKRs ([read here about OKRS w/ Examples](http://borg.csueastbay.edu/~grewe/CS230/Mat/Lectures/Entrepreneur/Entrepreneur.html)) as it relates to the tech product/service your company will offer.
  * how to measure success metrics/measurables on your OKRs for your company. [Read here about OKRs and Examples](http://borg.csueastbay.edu/~grewe/CS230/Mat/Lectures/Entrepreneur/Entrepreneur.html) - note Later in Item 4 you will describe experiments you will create to measure the success of your OKRs
 * how to differentiate from other companies in the field?

F. Slogan - summarize in 6 words or less the company's goals/objectives (here are some I have used for different research projects/labs: bringing mobility to the low vision, human-centric vision solving real problems).

## Item 2 : Cultural Policy (minimum 150 words)

A. Core Values - Give core values of company answering questions: How do you want to be thought of? What are the details of the core values of the company?

B. Motivation - Give an understanding of the desired company culture by answering: What do you love? What do you fear?

C. Summary: summary in 6 words or less the company's culture
Example of Google's Cultural Summary:
 1. Openness
 2. Innovation
 3. Excellence that comes with smartness
 4. Hands-on approach
 5. Small-company-family rapport

## Item 3 : Ethics Policy (minimum 500 words)
* Core Items - Enumerate the core items in your ethics policy and give details of each policy item and its meaning.
* Board - List 3 real people (maybe tech leaders) that you want on your board, a brief bio AND why you choose them for the board.

TIPS on Ethics Policies
Look at examples like Google Ethics policy (found [here](https://ai.google/principles/) or search)
 
Consider the following ideas from AI NOW report 2018:
1. Expanding AI fairness beyond a focus on mathematics and statistical fairness toward issues of justice
2. Accounting for the many forms of labor required to create and maintain AI systems
3. Committing to deeper interdisciplinary in AI
4. Analyzing race, gender and power in AI
5. Developing new policy interventions and strategic litigation
6. Building coalitions between researchers, civil society, and organizers within the technology sector

## Item 4 : Experimentation & Priorities

A. Experimentation (to test OKRs of Strategy) - restate your Strategy from the Business Proposal in terms of a series of experiments that the company will perform to test ideas.EXPRESS in DETAIL how you can cheaply create prototype (does not have to be functional...think outside box) to use in your experiments. Tell what TOOLS can you use to create your experiments. Tell how can you involve potential customers in your experiments. These Experiments will implement the measurables to see if you are successfully achieving your goals (OKRs)

B. Priorities- Give which experiment/hypothesis you will test first - as it is a high priority

## Item 5 : YouTube Presentation (see below requirement) - give URL

A. Presentation YouTube - create a YouTube (accessible) presentation (<15 minutes) that goes over in detail your GitHub wiki-based documentation. The wiki must be clearly readable in your video and your voice must be clear and audible. You should discuss ALL items 1-4 in your document.

B. Presentation Lightning Round Presentations In Person (see deliverables below for date and time): your group will have approximately 5 minutes to do a speed presentation where you will discuss:
* ITEM 1-Company Name, Vision, Introduce your Team
* Discussion ONE point of your Ethics Policy (ITEM 3)
* Discuss ONE point of your Cultural Policies (ITEM 2)
* Discuss one of your Ethics Board Members(ITEM 3).

This in-person presentation will be recorded for attendance. It is critical you come so you can hear about other presentations. It will help you along with the YouTube presentation to evaluate other groups work (remember this is a peer evaluated project). NOTE: it is up to you to choose which one item of the ethics policy, one item of cultural policy and which one ethics board member you will discuss.
